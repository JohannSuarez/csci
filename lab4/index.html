<h3>CSCI 330 Lab 4: grammars, lex, yacc</h3>

For labs 4 and 5 you'll be editing and submitting lex and yacc files,
compiled using lex and yacc on otter (or the cubs/pups).
<p></p>
The actual grammar changes for lab 4 are relatively basic, to give students
an opportunity to become familiar with the use of lex and yacc.  The lab 5
lex/yacc work will be significantly more involved.
<p></p>
Again, you'll be forking, cloning, editing, and submitting a git repository,
following the same basic command sequence except it's named lab4 this time.

<p></p><b>Objectives</b><p></p>
Lab 4 is meant to give you practice with regular expressions, context free grammars,
and their use in syntax checking source code using tools like lex/flex and yacc/bison.
<p></p>
You will be using lex regular expressions to describe the tokens in a language,
and yacc CFG rules to describe the syntax of the language.
<p></p>  A makefile is provided
to allow you to compile your lex and yacc files into a tool that can be used
to check for syntax errors in user source code, e.g.
<pre>
make lab4
./lab4 < filename
</pre>
The lab4 executable processes the specified file content, and displays error messages
if it detects any syntax errors.  (If no error messages are displayed then it is
assumed the file contained valid source code under the language rules.)

<p></p><b>Recommended viewing</b><p></p>
It is strongly recommended that you review the grammar, lex, and yacc slides/videos
listed for the weeks of Mar 1-5 and 8-12, though for this lab you'll be using a relatively
simple subset of the lex/yacc features.

<p></p><hr><p></p>
<p></p><b>Requirements</b><p></p>
A sample lab4.lex and lab4.yacc files have been provided for you,
that handle tokens and grammar rules described in the "Token types" and "CFG grammar rules"
sections below.
<ul><table border="1"><tr><td>
<em>Informally:</em> it currently expects user source code to have the form
<br> <tt>DATASET integer , integer , integer , integer .</tt>
<br> where there are one or more integers, integers consist of one or more digits (0-9),
and any amount/form of whitespace is permitted between tokens.
</td></tr></table></ul>
<p></p>
The requirements for the lab are as follows:
<ul>
<li> Revise the contents of the lab4.lex file to handle the additional and altered
token rules described below.
<li> Revise the contents of the lab4.yacc file to handle the additional and altered
CFG grammar rules described below.
<li> Ensure the lab4.lex and lab4.yacc files compile cleanly (no error/warning messages)
when using "make lab4".
<li> Revise the contents of the "tests" subdirectory and "tests.sh" script to
provide some automated testing of your compiled lab4 executable.
</ul>

<p></p><hr><p></p>
<p></p><b>Token types</b>(lab4.lex)<p></p>
The lab4.lex file currently implements the following token types
<table border="1"><tr><td>Token type</td><td>Token rules</td></tr>
<tr><td>INTEGER</td><td>one or more digits</td></tr>
<tr><td>START</td><td>string "DATASET"</td></tr>
<tr><td>STOP</td><td>string "."</td></tr>
<tr><td>COMMA</td><td>string ","</td></tr>
</table>
<p></p>
For the revised grammar, INTEGER can no longer begin with a 0
<br> i.e. the first digit must be in [1-9], then zero or more digits [0-9]
<p></p>
For the revised grammar, you need to add additional token types as follows:
<table border="1"><tr><td>Token type</td><td>Token rules</td></tr>
<tr><td>POSTAL</td><td>Six characters: alternating alphas [a-zA-Z] then digits [0-9]</td></tr>
<tr><td>NAME</td><td>One or more alphabetic characters [a-zA-Z]</td></tr>
<tr><td>SPLIT</td><td>string ":"</td></tr>
</table>
Note that you'll likely want to add a new character set for alphabetic characters
(similar to the current Digit definition), and you'll need to determine
suitable lex regular expressions for NAME and POSTAL (as well as modifying
the regex for INTEGER).

<p></p><hr><p></p>
<p></p><b>CFG grammar rules</b>(lab4.yacc)<p></p>
The current rules are shown below, showing tokens in UPPERCASE and nonterminals
in lowercase
<pre>
datafile --> START list STOP
list --> entry
list --> entry COMMA list
entry --> INTEGER
</pre>
You will be changing the <tt>entry</tt> rule to
<br><tt> entry --> INTEGER NAME SPLIT POSTAL</tt>
<br>(This should be a relatively simple alteration in the .yacc file.)

<p></p><hr><p></p>
<p></p><b>lex and yacc reminders</b><p></p>
Remember that each token type specified in the .lex file
needs a corresponding entry in the .yacc file on the tokens line:
<br> %token&lt;long> INTEGER START etc
<p></p>
In the .lex file, don't forget to adjust <tt>col</tt> by the
number of characters in the token that was read.

<p></p><hr><p></p><b>Testing</b><p></p>
To get started with testing, here are a few simple examples of valid and invalid source
code under the grammar.
<p></p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td><b>File</b></td><td><b>Notes</b></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Sample valid files</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
DATASET 37 Fred : A1B2C3 .
</pre></td><td>single entry, all one line</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
DATASET
   37
Fred:A1B2C3     .
</pre></td><td>single entry, varying whitespace</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
DATASET
2047 X : F0X4H8 ,
37 Fred : A1B2C3 ,
9 Bob : Z9Z9Z9
.
</pre></td><td>multiple entries</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Sample invalid files</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>

<tr><td><pre>

<tr><td><pre>
